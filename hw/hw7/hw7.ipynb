    "\n",
    "Let's try `DBSCAN` on our toy dataset. K-Means is kind of bound to the Euclidean distance because it is based on the notion of means. With `DBSCAN` we can try different distance metrics. In the context of text (sparse data), [cosine similarities](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/metrics.html#cosine-similarity) or cosine distances tend to work better. Given vectors $u$ and $v$, the **cosine distance** between the vectors is defined as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$distance_{cosine}(u,v) = 1 - (\\frac{u \\cdot v}{\\left\\lVert u\\right\\rVert_2 \\left\\lVert v\\right\\rVert_2})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll use DBSCAN with cosine distances. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your tasks**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use DBSCAN to cluster our toy data using sentence embedding representation (`emb_sents`) and `metric='cosine'`. \n",
    "2. Briefly comment on the number of clusters identified and the cluster assignment given by the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Note: You will also have to set appropriate values for the hyperparamters `eps` and `min_samples` to get meaningful clusters, as default values for these hyperparameters won't work on this toy dataset. In order to set appropriate value for `eps`, you may want to examine the distances given by [sklearn's `cosine_distance`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_distances.html).*"
